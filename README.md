# SmartTjunction

A cooperative multitasking simulation and control system for a smart T-junction traffic light network, implemented on a **Raspberry Pi Pico** and an **ILI9341 TFT display**. This project was developed as part of the *Real-Time Systems Laboratory* course (0512-4494) at **Tel Aviv University**.

## Overview

SmartTjunction emulates a real-world T-junction traffic control system by combining time-based logic, vehicle flow simulation, and live feedback on a graphical dashboard. It demonstrates:

1. **Vehicle generation** using:
   - Manual mode (pushbuttons)
   - Stochastic Markov-like random generation

2. **Traffic light sequencing** using round-robin scheduling:
   - Red ‚Üí Yellow (0.5s) ‚Üí Green (1‚Äì7s) per light

3. **Dynamic optimization**:
   - Every 30 seconds, the system re-evaluates queue lengths and thrown vehicles to adjust green-light durations dynamically.

4. **Live monitoring**:
   - A graphical UI on the TFT shows light states, mode, vehicle counts, and optimizations.

5. **Serial logging**:
   - Logs key events with timestamps (light changes, vehicle flow, optimizations) over USB serial at 57600‚ÄØbaud.
